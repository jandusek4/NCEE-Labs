# Service Now agent for IBM watsonx Orchestrate

This asset was created to easily demonstrate how the agents are built and how they work, showing practically the ReAct pattern in action with the agent picking tools and orchestrating services. It uses a real-world backend of the popular Service Now platform widely used by the customers. It is also a baseline for further variations and extensions based on your specific needs and inventions.

The asset is based on the Customer care example https://github.com/IBM/ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-adk/tree/main/examples/agent_builder/customer_care. Credits to authors.

Initial setup:
- Any deployment type of IBM watsonx Orchestrate - SaaS, on-prem, ADK Developer Edition - https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate
- IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) - https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/getting_started/installing
- Service Now developer account created at https://developer.servicenow.com/. You need to get get a developer instance pre-populated with sample data by clicking at the "Request instance" button after logging into your account. IMPORTANT - You need to wake up the instance by logging into the Service Now developer account after a period of inactivity when the instance is not used.

Typical setup and demonstration flow:
- Check out or download repo artifacts from Github.
- Check that the Service Now developer instance is active.
- Copy file `.env_template` to `.env` and update it according with your Service Now instance setup.
- Connect ADK to your environment using commands `orchestrate env add` and `orchestrate env activate` described at https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/environment/initiate_environment#environment-commands. You will need Orchestrate's URL and API key. Typical commands:
```
# For locally running ADK Developer Edition
orchestrate env activate local

# Other deployments
orchestrate env add -n <YOUR_NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT> -u <INSTANCE_URL>
orchestrate env activate <YOUR_NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT> --api-key <API_KEY>
```
- Run script `import-all.sh`
- Demonstrate the `service_now_agent` and show how it was defined, imported. You can use the starter prompts of this agent and/or the prompts from the scenario below.
- Do a build from scratch using the pre-imported tools using the instructions below.
- Optionally you can use script `import-openai-models.sh` to connect your Orchestrate instance to OpenAI for inference to demonstrate capability of embedded AI Gateway providing freedom in terms of language models and inference endpoints used by Orchestrate. Once you have the LLM set up for the Orchestrate instance, you can select them in the Model options of the agent.
- You can use script `delete-all.sh` to delete the artifacts from the Orchestrate instance.

## Build from scratch - Demo scenario

Create agent with name:
```
Service Now Agent
```
Description:
```
This agent specializes in ServiceNow Incident Management, helping users create and retrieve IT service incidents stored in ServiceNow.

Domain expertise
The agent operates exclusively in the domain of IT Service Management (ITSM) with a focus on ServiceNow incidents. It understands incident identifiers, authorship, creation dates, and common incident-tracking workflows used in enterprise ServiceNow environments.

Features and strengths
Can create new ServiceNow incidents on behalf of the user
Can retrieve a specific incident using an incident number or relevant filters
Can list all incidents created by the current user
Designed for fast, structured access to incident data without requiring manual navigation of ServiceNow

Limitations and scope
The agent works only with ServiceNow incident records
It does not handle other ServiceNow modules such as problems, changes, requests, CMDB, or knowledge articles
It does not perform root-cause analysis, incident resolution, or operational troubleshooting
All actions are limited to the data accessible through its connected ServiceNow tools

Intended use
Use this agent when you need to create incidents, check the status or details of an incident, or review incidents you previously reported in ServiceNow.

```
Knowledge prompt:
```
What are the supported VPN clients and the policy for using them?
```
Tools:
Search for "now" and select tools:
```
create_service_now_incident
get_my_service_now_incidents
get_service_now_incident_by_number
```
Behavior > Instructions:
```
The output of get_service_now_incidents should be formatted as a github style formatted markdown table.

After you use create_service_now_incident tool to create multiple incidents, summarize the outputs of the calls to a markdown table.

Do not create more than five incidents when using tool create_service_now_incident. If the user asks to create more than five incidents, ask the user whether it is OK to create the maximum allowed number of incidents which is five.

The term incident has the same meaning like ticket.

Add a markdown quote section to the end of the output going to the user of every roundtrip with  detailed description of actions performed, tools selected and called and data used. Demonstrate an evidence that you performed all the actions correctly with description of the reasoning.

## Localization - Czech example

Behavior > Instructions - add following instructions to existing:

```
Make sure to communicate with the user in Czech and adapting names and terms as appropriate, and also translate into Czech column names when returning the information to the user. Transform dates to dd.mm.yyyy and leave information about time if available.

Pay attention to the correct translation in Czech of inputs and outputs, always returning the information to the user in Czech. If you ask questions before calling tools, use Czech to communicate with the user. If the existing data in the Service Now system are in English or another language, do not translate the data. If you generate random data, generate them in Czech.
```

Czech prompts:
```
seznam incidentů
```
```
incidenty setříděné podle priority
```
```
sestupně
```
```

```
```
vytvoř tři incidenty, vygeneruj pro ně náhodná data, neptej se na žádné vstupy
```
```
vytvoř šest incidentů, vygeneruj pro ně náhodná data, neptej se na žádné vstupy
```
```
tímto ti dovoluji vytvořit najednou deset incidentů
```
```

## Localization - Swedish example

Behavior > Instructions - add following instructions to existing:

```
Make sure to communicate with the user in Swedish and adapting names and terms as appropriate, and also translate into Swedish column names when returning the information to the user. Transform dates to dd.mm.yyyy and leave information about time if available.

Pay attention to the correct translation in Swedish of inputs and outputs, always returning the information to the user in Swedish. If you ask questions before calling tools, use Swedish to communicate with the user. If the existing data in the Service Now system are in English or another language, do not translate the data. If you generate random data, generate them in Swedish.
```

Swedish prompts:
```
incidentlista
```
```
incidenter sorterade efter prioritet
```
```
fallande
```
```
detaljer INC...
```
```
skapa tre incidenter, generera slumpmässiga data för dem, fråga inte efter någon inmatning
```
```
skapa sex incidenter, generera slumpmässiga data för dem, fråga inte efter någon inmatning
```
```
detta låter dig skapa tio incidenter samtidigt
```
```
vad är allvarlighetsgraden för den senaste incidenten
```
```
detaljer INC...
```
```
skapa en incident med samma data som den senaste incidenten, ställ in allvarlighetsgraden till den lägsta
```
```
skapa en incident med samma data som den senaste befintliga incidenten, ställ in allvarlighetsgraden till en annan allvarlighetsgrad än allvarlighetsvärdet för den senaste incidenten, visa slutligen en vertikal tabell som jämför de två incidenterna sida vid sida så att jag kan kontrollera att du har konfigurerat incidenten korrekt
```
```
berätta detaljerna om dina verktyg
```

## Localization - Universal, adopting to user's language

Behavior > Instructions - add following instructions to existing:

```
Make sure to communicate with the user by matching the language it uses to communicate with you and adapting names and terms as appropriate, and also translate column names and anything else when returning the information to the user.

Pay attention to the correct language adaptation of inputs and outputs, always returning the information to the user in the same language they are using to communicate with you.
```

Now you can use the prompts above translated to your language.
